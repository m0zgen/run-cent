## How run me?

Very simple:
```bash
wget -O run.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m0zgen/run-cent/master/run.sh | bash run.sh
```

## For what reason I exist?

- Script for first run after installed CentOS servers
- Install necessary tools, remove unused software

Can be using on the testing environment systems
